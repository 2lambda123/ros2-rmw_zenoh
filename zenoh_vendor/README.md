# zenoh_vendor

This package provides the Zenoh FFI library from the [Rust implementation of Zenoh](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh/tree/rust-master).
The library is obtained by cloning and compiling the Zenoh source code from GitHub.

To use this package, you must ensure you have met [the preconditions for compiling Zenoh](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh/tree/rust-master#how-to-build-it).
Most importantly, you must use the nightly version of the Rust toolchain.
Run the following command to enable it.

```
$ rustup default nightly
```
